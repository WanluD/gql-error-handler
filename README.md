Certainly! Here's an example of an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for a simple GraphQL query:

Query Example:

query {
  user(id: "123") {
    id
    username
  }
}


```javascript
{
  kind: 'Document',
  definitions: [
    {
      kind: 'OperationDefinition',
      operation: 'query',
      selectionSet: {
        kind: 'SelectionSet',
        selections: [
          {
            kind: 'Field',
            name: {
              kind: 'Name',
              value: 'user',
            },
            arguments: [
              {
                kind: 'Argument',
                name: {
                  kind: 'Name',
                  value: 'id',
                },
                value: {
                  kind: 'StringValue',
                  value: '123',
                },
              },
            ],
            selectionSet: {
              kind: 'SelectionSet',
              selections: [
                {
                  kind: 'Field',
                  name: {
                    kind: 'Name',
                    value: 'id',
                  },
                },
                {
                  kind: 'Field',
                  name: {
                    kind: 'Name',
                    value: 'username',
                  },
                },
              ],
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

This AST represents a GraphQL query that fetches a user's `id` and `username` based on their `id` argument. Let's break down the structure of this AST:

- `kind: 'Document'`: This is the root of the AST, representing the entire GraphQL document.

- `definitions`: An array containing one or more GraphQL operation definitions or fragment definitions.

  - `kind: 'OperationDefinition'`: This represents an operation, which can be either a query (`'query'`), mutation (`'mutation'`), or subscription (`'subscription'`).

    - `operation: 'query'`: In this case, it's a query operation.

    - `selectionSet`: This defines the selection set of fields to be queried within the operation.

      - `kind: 'SelectionSet'`: Represents a set of field selections.

      - `selections`: An array of field selections to be queried.

        - `kind: 'Field'`: Represents a field selection.

        - `name`: Contains the name of the field being queried.

          - `kind: 'Name'`: Represents a name.

          - `value: 'user'`: The name of the field is "user."

        - `arguments`: An array of arguments passed to the field.

          - `kind: 'Argument'`: Represents an argument.

          - `name`: Contains the name of the argument.

            - `kind: 'Name'`: Represents a name.

            - `value: 'id'`: The name of the argument is "id."

          - `value`: Represents the value of the argument.

            - `kind: 'StringValue'`: Represents a string value.

            - `value: '123'`: The value of the argument is the string "123."

        - `selectionSet`: If the field has subfields to be queried, this defines the subfield selections.

          - `kind: 'SelectionSet'`: Represents a set of subfield selections.

          - `selections`: An array of subfield selections.

            - `kind: 'Field'`: Represents a subfield selection.

            - `name`: Contains the name of the subfield.

              - `kind: 'Name'`: Represents a name.

              - `value: 'id'`: The name of the subfield is "id" (subfield of "user").

              - `value: 'username'`: The name of the subfield is "username" (subfield of "user").

This example demonstrates how a GraphQL query is structured as an AST with various nodes representing different aspects of the query. The AST is a structured representation that makes it easier to analyze and manipulate GraphQL queries programmatically.
